Little progress:
A bug where accidentally swapping input/bidir pins was fixed.
The computed or board being used to dev on was found to be broken and
couldn't read from the SD card properly.
Switching to a different computer seemed to fix the issue.
At the end of the lab, the call to find file by extension terminated, but
returned no results.

What did we fuck up?
====================

(November 7, 2014)
- Sector calculations: Accidentally calculated file to have way more sectors
  than it actually did, by using the wrong constant in the calculation.
- Forgetting to call init: Strange failures without nice error messages.
- Given code did not allocate sufficient space for the filename, causing
  changes to another field in the struct to overwrite it.
- Spent a long time refactoring and cleaning up the given FAT code to make
  it clearer, fixed a few bugs and a lot of maintainability and readability
  issues.
- We had to turn on optimization in order to get the audio file to play back
  fast enough.
- Learned a lot about how the FAT filesystem works.
