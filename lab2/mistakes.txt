What did we fuck up?
====================

(November 7, 2014)
- Sector calculations: Accidentally calculated file to have way more sectors
  than it actually did, by using the wrong constant in the calculation.
- Forgetting to call init: Strange failures without nice error messages.
- Given code did not allocate sufficient space for the filename, causing
  changes to another field in the struct to overwrite it.
- Spent a long time refactoring and cleaning up the given FAT code to make
  it clearer, fixed a few bugs and a lot of maintainability and readability
  issues.
- We had to turn on optimization in order to get the audio file to play back
  fast enough.
