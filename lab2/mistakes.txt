Little progress:
A bug where accidentally swapping input/bidir pins was fixed.
The computed or board being used to dev on was found to be broken and
couldn't read from the SD card properly.
Switching to a different computer seemed to fix the issue.
At the end of the lab, the call to find file by extension terminated, but
returned no results.

- Sector calculations: Accidentally calculated file to have way more sectors
  than it actually did, by using the wrong constant in the calculation.
- Forgetting to call init: Strange failures without nice error messages.
- Given code did not allocate sufficient space for the filename, causing
  changes to another field in the struct to overwrite it.
- Spent a long time refactoring and cleaning up the given FAT code to make
  it clearer, fixed a few bugs and a lot of maintainability and readability
  issues.
- We had to turn on optimization in order to get the audio file to play back
  fast enough.
- Learned a lot about how the FAT filesystem works.

- Turns out our CPU doesn't have hardware divide/multiply. This means %
  operations (which we were using for our ring buffer), are really slow.
- This made the audio really choppy.
- Still can't figure out why timers are not working.
